You guys are wondering what this is.

Let me explain...👇

👉 Basically,  this is the program which can draw any string (of max. 2 words ) automatically. 
👉You can give input of color,size and string, you want to print.
👉This program uses the marker , which can draw  anything by moving on the console.

🤔How is it designed??👇

👉It is designed by using 'turtle' module of python.
👉We don't need to install this package externally. This module comes along with the IDLE of python.
👉I had to go through the documentation of turtle module.
👉Besides that , I also had to determine the actual size of screen.
